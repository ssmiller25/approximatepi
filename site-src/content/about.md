# About This Site

First, a celebration of Approximate Pi, and promoting the idea of really celebrating "Pi" day on 7/22 - a far more accurate representation then 3/14!

Also a celebration of Web V0/V1, and personal homepages.  Checkout [Yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org/).  As a DevOps engineer, I'm using a bit more of a modern stack, and really this site is hosted on multiple providers.  [Checkout my personal page](https://www.r15cookie.com/) for more information about me, or the source code on this page [on Github](https://github.com/ssmiller25/approximatepi)

Theme heavily based on [this mother-loving website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
